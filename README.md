## Python DNS Server
This code creates a simple DNS proxy that listens for DNS queries on port 53 and forwards the queries to Cloudflare's DNS server over TLS. When it receives a response from Cloudflare, it sends the response back to the client.

The proxy listens for incoming connections on a TCP socket bound to the localhost (127.0.0.1) on port 53. When it receives a connection, it receives the client's DNS query and creates a TLS context. It then connects to Cloudflare's DNS server over TLS using the wrapped socket and sends the query to the server. 
When it receives a response from the server, it sends the response back to the client and closes the client and server sockets. 
The proxy then waits for the next incoming connection.

### Configuring the DNS Server
To configure the DNS server, you will need to modify the simple_proxy.py file.

#### Bind the socket to the correct IP address:

`sock.bind(("127.0.0.1", 53))`

Replace "127.0.0.1" with the IP address of the host machine that you want to bind the socket to. This can be the external IP address of the host machine if you want to make the DNS server accessible from the internet, or the internal IP address of the host machine if you want to make the DNS server only accessible on the local network.

#### Set the destination IP address for forwarded DNS requests:

`DNS_SERVER_ADDRESS = ("1.1.1.1", 853)`
This is the IP address that the DNS server will use as the destination for forwarded DNS requests.
In this case the python DNS server forwards requests to Cloudflare over a TLS connection.

### Running the DNS Server
There are two ways to run the DNS server:

Via the command line:

`sudo python3 simple_proxy.py`

This will start the DNS server and bind it to the localhost (127.0.0.1) on port 53.

Via Docker:

`docker build -t my_dns_server .`

`$ docker run --network=host -p 53:53 my_dns_server python3 simple_proxy.py`

This will build a Docker image based on the Dockerfile and run it in a container. The -p 53:53 flag maps the host machine's port 53 to the container's port 53, so that the DNS server will be accessible on the host machine's port 53.

### Testing the DNS Server
Testing the DNS Server
To test the DNS server while it is running, you can use the following commands:

#### Check if the DNS server is running:

`ps aux | grep python`

This will list all processes running on the system that contain the word "python" in their command line. If the DNS server is running, you should see an entry for it in the list.

#### Check if the DNS server is listening on port 53:

`sudo lsof -i :53`

This will list all processes that are listening on port 53. If the DNS server is running and listening on port 53, you should see an entry for it in the list.

#### Test the DNS server using dig:

`dig google.com @127.0.0.1`

This will send a DNS request for the domain name google.com to the DNS server running on 127.0.0.1. If the DNS server is working correctly, you should see the DNS record for google.com in the output.

#### You can also use the nslookup command to test the DNS server:


` nslookup google.com 127.0.0.1 `

If the DNS server is working correctly, you should see the DNS record for google.com in the output.

### Further Development
If this DNS proxy were to be deployed in an infrastructure, there are several security concerns that I would raise:

1. Data leakage: The DNS proxy may be able to see sensitive information contained in DNS requests and responses, such as the names and IP addresses of domain names being resolved. This information could potentially be leaked if the DNS proxy is not properly secured.

3. Man-in-the-middle attacks: The DNS proxy is a point of intermediation between the client and the destination DNS server. If the DNS proxy is not secure, it could be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker could intercept and modify DNS requests and responses.

3. Denial of service attacks: The DNS proxy could be a target for denial of service attacks, where an attacker could flood the DNS proxy with a large number of requests in order to overwhelm it and make it unavailable to legitimate users.

To integrate this solution into a distributed, microservices-oriented, and containerized architecture, I would recommend the following:

1. Use a load balancer or reverse proxy to distribute incoming DNS requests to a group of DNS proxy instances, rather than a single instance. This will help to improve availability and scalability.

2. Use container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to manage the DNS proxy instances as a group, and to handle the deployment and scaling of the instances as needed.

3. Use service discovery tools such as Consul or etcd to enable the DNS proxy instances to discover each other and communicate with each other.

4. Use a centralized logging and monitoring solution to collect logs and metrics from the DNS proxy instances, and to alert on any issues or anomalies.

#### Future improvements:
• Caching: To improve performance and reduce the load on the destination DNS server, the DNS proxy could implement caching of DNS records. The DNS proxy could store the responses received from the destination DNS server in a cache, and use the cached responses to serve subsequent requests for the same domain name.

• Protocol support: Currently, the DNS proxy only supports DNS over TCP. It would be interesting to add support for DNS over UDP and other protocols such as DoT (DNS over TLS) and DoH (DNS over HTTPS).

• Security: To improve security, the DNS proxy could implement measures such as encryption of DNS requests and responses, and authentication of clients and servers.

• Configuration: It would be useful to add a configuration system that allows the DNS proxy to be easily configured and customized without requiring code changes. This could include options such as the destination DNS server to use, the cache expiration time, and security settings.

• Testing: It would be important to add a comprehensive test suite to the DNS proxy project to ensure that it is reliable and behaves as expected. This could include unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests.
